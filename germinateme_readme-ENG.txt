◯ About This Game

The objective of this game is to buy seeds, germinate and harvest them, and then sell the crops at the right time to make a profit.
Due to limitations of the game engine, Japanese is not supported, so the game is entirely in English.
Please note that the English translations were done using Google Translate and ChatGPT, so they may not always be perfectly accurate in context.
Estimated play time is about 10 minutes.

◯ Basic Gameplay Flow

Start by purchasing seeds using the number keys. (Your current balance is shown at the top of the screen.)
Seeds are automatically planted. After that, you just wait and they will be harvested automatically.
Press the ENTER key to advance time.
Once harvested, the crops appear in the HOLD column.
To sell a crop, press the crop’s number plus 4. You will earn money from the sale.
Use that money to buy more seeds and grow your funds.

◯ Time System

The smallest unit of time in this game is one "week".

The game follows a structure based on the academic calendar of the University of Tsukuba.
Each year is divided into two seasons: spring and autumn.
Each season is further divided into three modules: A, B, and C.
Each module consists of five weeks.
The game begins in Spring Module A, Week 1, and ends in Autumn Module C, Week 5.
There are a total of 30 weeks in the game.

Once you finish planting and selling for the current week, press ENTER to move to the next week.

◯ Crops

To buy and plant a seed, enter the number shown to the left of the colon at the bottom of the screen.
The initial of the planted crop will appear in the field area in the center of the screen.
The number below the initial shows how many weeks are left until the crop can be harvested.
There are four types of crops available in both spring and autumn.
Autumn crops have higher starting buy and sell prices.

Crop 1: Potato (Spring) / Turnip (Autumn) – Grows in 2 weeks. Grows quickly but offers low profits.
Crop 2: Corn / Radish – Grows in 4 weeks.
Crop 3: Melon / Pumpkin – Grows in 6 weeks. Takes longer to grow but sells for a high price.
Crop 4: Tomato / Grape – Grows in 3 weeks. High profitability, but a 1 in 6 chance to wither each week.

◯ Selling

Your current crop inventory is displayed in the HOLD column at the bottom of the screen.
To sell a crop, press its number plus 4, or the key one row below it.
(For example, to sell Potatoes or Turnips, press 5 or Q.)

When the season changes from spring to autumn, all crops planted in the fields will wither and all harvested crops in your inventory will rot.
Therefore, you must decide when to sell based on fluctuating prices before the season changes.
Prices change every week.

If the selling price drops below the buying price, the selling price becomes four times the buying price.
When prices are about to reverse, it might be a good time to buy.

Press the 0 key to view whether buy and sell prices have increased or decreased compared to the previous week.
Blue indicates a better deal than last week, and red indicates a worse deal.

◯ Events

There is a 20% chance that one of the following events will occur when changing modules:

* Pests arrive and eat the crop that is closest to being harvested.
* A sudden surge or drop in demand causes a sharp fluctuation in selling prices.
* Due to weather conditions, growth may be delayed or accelerated by one week.
* Thieves steal all of the crop you have the most of in your inventory.

◯ Game Over and Scoring

If you are close to bankruptcy and feel you cannot continue, press X to give up and restart.
The game ends automatically after 30 weeks and your score will be displayed.

Score formula: (Number of harvested crops – Number of withered crops) × (Final money – 100)
